  <ul>
    <li>Gif: The GIF format is a type of bitmap, but unlike
JPEG or PNG, GIF files are limited to a maximum of 256 colors. While GIF is generally a
bad choice for images with a lot of colors, the 256 color limit can help keep file sizes small
which is ideal for even the slowest of internet speeds. For many years, GIF provided the web’s only
transparency option. </li>
    <li>JPEG: The JPEG format can blend red, blue and green light to display millions of color.
This makes JPG very ‘photo-friendly’. This is partly why it is a standard format when it comes
to most digital cameras on the market. </li>
    <li>PNG: The PNG format is similar to GIF in many ways and has the same 256 color limit. It has
better transparency options and usually exports slightly smaller file sizes. However,
PNG-8 has no animation function. </li>
