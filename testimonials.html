      <p>Barbera, age 29. "I have lived in Miami Beach for 11 years, and
        I have never gotten bored. Whether I am spending the entire day at the
        beach, or walking along Lincoln Road, shopping. During the night, I feel
        like the city never stops, there is always something to be doing. If I ever get
        bored, I can take a quick flight to Mexico or the Caribbean due to close
        proximity." </p>

      <p>John, age 45. "I don't even know how long I have lived in Miami for but all
        I can say is that I absolutely love it here! I think it is such a great atmosphere
        to raise my kids in. Not only do my kids learn how to have fun, they learn how to
        be independent and navigate a city."

      <p>Amy, age 17. "Growing up on Miami Beach, I would not trade in my experiences
        for anything. I lived the vibrant night life and the beautiful, accessible beaches
        which were filled with sunshine. I love that I could just walk down to the beach
        and do my homework or that during school we could walk down the street and get take out.
        Miami Beach is the best and I recommend visiting."
